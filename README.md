congress_words
=========

It takes your word or phrase of choice as an input and it outputs a map of the US showing how many times each state has a representative saying that word or phrase in congress, normalized by the number of congress memebers for each state. It outputs a .svg file.

It works using the API's of capitolwords.org, make sure to change my API key with yours when trying it out.

Also, I make use of the BeautifulSoup module.
