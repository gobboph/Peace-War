congress_words
=========

Here is the html and javascript code for the congress_words project.

You can see the outcome directly in your browser [here](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/). Just type a word or expression of your choice and generate a map colored in different shades depending on how many times a member of each state pronounced that word or expression, normalized by the number of congress members per state.

For a python script that generates .svg files, check out the master branch of this project. Notice, however, that this branch does not use python, but everything is encoded in javascript, making things easier and faster for internet support. 

The whole project works using the API's of capitolwords.org.

If you do not believe that the result is cool, here is an example generated using the python script. But again, go try it yourself [here](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/)!

This map is generated using the word 'welfare':
